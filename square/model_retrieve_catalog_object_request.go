type RetrieveCatalogObjectRequest struct {
	// If `true`, the response will include additional objects that are related to the requested objects. Related objects are defined as any objects referenced by ID by the results in the `objects` field of the response. These objects are put in the `related_objects` field. Setting this to `true` is helpful when the objects are needed for immediate display to a user. This process only goes one level deep. Objects referenced by the related objects will not be included. For example,  if the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItem, its associated CatalogCategory objects, CatalogTax objects, CatalogImage objects and CatalogModifierLists will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the response. If the `objects` field of the response contains a CatalogItemVariation, its parent CatalogItem will be returned in the `related_objects` field of the response.  Default value: `false`
	IncludeRelatedObjects bool `json:"include_related_objects,omitempty"`
	// Requests objects as of a specific version of the catalog. This allows you to retrieve historical versions of objects. The value to retrieve a specific version of an object can be found in the version field of [CatalogObject](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square_2024-07-17/objects/CatalogObject)s. If not included, results will be from the current version of the catalog.
	CatalogVersion int64 `json:"catalog_version,omitempty"`
	// Specifies whether or not to include the `path_to_root` list for each returned category instance. The `path_to_root` list consists of `CategoryPathToRootNode` objects and specifies the path that starts with the immediate parent category of the returned category and ends with its root category. If the returned category is a top-level category, the `path_to_root` list is empty and is not returned in the response payload.
	IncludeCategoryPathToRoot bool `json:"include_category_path_to_root,omitempty"`
