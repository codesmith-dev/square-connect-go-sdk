        Creates an employee role you can then assign to employees.

        Square accounts can include any number of roles that can be assigned to
        employees. These roles define the actions and permissions granted to an
        employee with that role. For example, an employee with a "Shift Manager"
        role might be able to issue refunds in Square Point of Sale, whereas an
        employee with a "Clerk" role might not.

        Roles are assigned with the [V1UpdateEmployee](#endpoint-v1updateemployee)
        endpoint. An employee can have only one role at a time.

        If an employee has no role, they have none of the permissions associated
        with roles. All employees can accept payments with Square Point of Sale.

        To import timecards from another

        considered clocked in if they have a timecard that doesn't have a
        `clockout_time` set. An employee that is currently clocked in cannot
        be clocked in a second time.

        Creates an item and at least one variation for it.



        Item-related entities include fields you can use to associate them with
        entities in a non-Square system.

        When you create an item-related entity, you can optionally specify `id`.
        This value must be unique among all IDs ever specified for the account,
        including those specified by other applications. You can never reuse an
        entity ID. If you do not specify an ID, Square generates one for the entity.

        Item variations have a `user_data` string that lets you associate arbitrary
        metadata with the variation. The string cannot exceed 255 characters.

        Provides comprehensive information for a single settlement.

        The returned `Settlement` objects include an `entries` field that lists
        the transactions that contribute to the settlement total. Most
        settlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement
        entries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual
        adjustments, or chargeback holds.

        Square initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the
        [Deposit Options with Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807)
        help article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available
        from Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.

        Square does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only
        whether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in
        a bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may
        take longer.

        Returns current counts for the provided

        Results are paginated and sorted in descending order according to their
        `calculated_at` timestamp (newest first).

        When `updated_after` is specified, only counts that have changed since that
        time (based on the server timestamp for the most recent change) are
        returned. This allows clients to perform a "sync" operation, for example
        in response to receiving a Webhook notification.

        with the `SqPaymentForm`)
        - Values for the `customer_card_id` and `customer_id` parameters (to charge

        _must_ provide values for the following parameters in your request:

        - `buyer_email_address`
        - At least one of `billing_address` or `shipping_address`

        When this response is returned, the amount of Square's processing fee might not yet be

        SearchOrders requests need to specify which locations to search and define a

        how to sort or filter the results. Your SearchOrdersQuery can:

          Determine whether to return results as complete Order objects, or as
        [OrderEntry](#type-orderentry) objects.

        Note that details for orders processed with Square Point of Sale while in
        offline mode may not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours. Offline
        orders have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the order was created,
        not the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square.

            A value you specify that uniquely identifies this
            request among all your requests. A common way to create
            a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique
            identifier (UUID).

            If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful,
            you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without
            worrying about creating duplicate objects.

            See [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/idempotency) for more information.
        batches:
          type: array
          description: |-
            A batch of CatalogObjects to be inserted/updated atomically.
            The objects within a batch will be inserted in an all-or-nothing fashion, i.e., if an error occurs
            attempting to insert or update an object within a batch, the entire batch will be rejected. However, an error
            in one batch will not affect other batches within the same request.

            For each object, its `updated_at` field is ignored and replaced with a current [timestamp](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-dates), and its
            `is_deleted` field must not be set to `true`.

            To modify an existing object, supply its ID. To create a new object, use an ID starting
            with `#`. These IDs may be used to create relationships between an object and attributes of
            other objects that reference it. For example, you can create a CatalogItem with
            ID `#ABC` and a CatalogItemVariation with its `item_id` attribute set to
            `#ABC` in order to associate the CatalogItemVariation with its parent
            CatalogItem.

            Any `#`-prefixed IDs are valid only within a single atomic batch, and will be replaced by server-generated IDs.

            Each batch may contain up to 1,000 objects. The total number of objects across all batches for a single request
            may not exceed 10,000. If either of these limits is violated, an error will be returned and no objects will
            be inserted or updated.

            Most discounts should use `MODIFY_TAX_BASIS`. However, in some circumstances taxes must
            be calculated based on an item's price, ignoring a particular discount. For example,
            in many US jurisdictions, a manufacturer coupon or instant rebate reduces the price a
            customer pays but does not reduce the sale price used to calculate how much sales tax is
            due. In this case, the discount representing that manufacturer coupon should have
            `DO_NOT_MODIFY_TAX_BASIS` for this field.

            A map (key-value pairs) of application-defined custom attribute values. The value of a key-value pair
            is a `CatalogCustomAttributeValue` object. The key is the `key` attribute
            value defined in the associated `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition`
            object defined by the application making the request.

            If the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` object is
            defined by another application, the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition`'s key attribute value is prefixed by
            the defining application ID. For example, if the `CatalogCustomAttributeDefinition` has a `key` attribute of
            `"cocoa_brand"` and the defining application ID is `"abcd1234"`, the key in the map is `"abcd1234:cocoa_brand"`
            if the application making the request is different from the application defining the custom attribute definition.
            Otherwise, the key used in the map is simply `"cocoa_brand"`.

        The wrapper object for the Catalog entries of a given object type.

        The type of a particular `CatalogObject` is determined by the value of the
        `type` attribute and only the corresponding data attribute can be set on the `CatalogObject` instance.
        For example, the following list shows some instances of `CatalogObject` of a given `type` and
        their corresponding data attribute that can be set:
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `ITEM` type, set the `item_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogItem` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `ITEM_VARIATION` type, set the `item_variation_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogItemVariation` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `MODIFIER` type, set the `modifier_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogModifier` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `MODIFIER_LIST` type, set the `modifier_list_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogModifierList` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `CATEGORY` type, set the `category_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogCategory` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `DISCOUNT` type, set the `discount_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogDiscount` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `TAX` type, set the `tax_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogTax` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `IMAGE` type, set the `image_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogImageData`  object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `QUICK_AMOUNTS_SETTINGS` type, set the `quick_amounts_settings_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogQuickAmountsSettings` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `PRICING_RULE` type, set the `pricing_rule_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogPricingRule` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `TIME_PERIOD` type, set the `time_period_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogTimePeriod` object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `PRODUCT_SET` type, set the `product_set_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogProductSet`  object.
        - For a `CatalogObject` of the `SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN` type, set the `subscription_plan_data` attribute to yield the `CatalogSubscriptionPlan` object.

      description: |-
        A query composed of one or more different types of filters to narrow the scope of targeted objects when calling the `SearchCatalogObjects` endpoint.

        Although a query can have multiple filters, only certain query types can be combined per call to [SearchCatalogObjects](#endpoint-Catalog-SearchCatalogObjects).
        Any combination of the following types may be used together:
        - [exact_query](#type-CatalogExactQuery)
        - [prefix_query](#type-CatalogPrefixQuery)
        - [range_query](#type-CatalogRangeQuery)
        - [sorted_attribute_query](#type-CatalogSortedAttribute)
        - [text_query](#type-CatalogTextQuery)
        All other query types cannot be combined with any others.

        When a query filter is based on an attribute, the attribute must be searchable.
        Searchable attributes are listed as follows, along their parent types that can be searched for with applicable query filters.

        * Searchable attribute and objects queryable by searchable attributes **
        - `name`:  `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemVariation`, `CatalogCategory`, `CatalogTax`, `CatalogDiscount`, `CatalogModifier`, 'CatalogModifierList`, `CatalogItemOption`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
        - `description`: `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`
        - `abbreviation`: `CatalogItem`
        - `upc`: `CatalogItemVariation`
        - `sku`: `CatalogItemVariation`
        - `caption`: `CatalogImage`
        - `display_name`: `CatalogItemOption`

        For example, to search for [CatalogItem](#type-CatalogItem) objects by searchable attributes, you can use
        the `"name"`, `"description"`, or `"abbreviation"` attribute in an applicable query filter.

            The idempotency key is used to avoid processing the same order more than
            once. If you're unsure whether a particular checkout was created
            successfully, you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key and all the
            same other parameters without worrying about creating duplicates.

            We recommend using a random number/string generator native to the language
            you are working in to generate strings for your idempotency keys.

            See the [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/working-with-apis/idempotency) guide for more information.

        provide the goods/services or refund the payment).

        Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,
        `CLOSED_AT` or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.
        You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
        for only one time range at a time.

        For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
        is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

        __Important:__ If you use the DateTimeFilter in a SearchOrders query,
        you must also set the `sort_field` in [OrdersSort](#type-searchorderordersort)
        to the same field you filter for. For example, if you set the `CLOSED_AT` field
        in DateTimeFilter, you must also set the `sort_field` in SearchOrdersSort to
        `CLOSED_AT`. Otherwise, SearchOrders will throw an error.

        <ul>
        <li>
        Monetary values are <b>positive</b> if they represent an
        <em>increase</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,
        <code>tax_money</code>, <code>tip_money</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
        Monetary values are <b>negative</b> if they represent an
        <em>decrease</em> in the amount of money the merchant receives (e.g.,
        <code>discount_money</code>, <code>refunded_money</code>).
        </li>
        </ul>

            tender amounts needed to pay for items purchased in the exchange.
      description: |-
        A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this
        exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the
        amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.

        Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such
        as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`
        field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.

        Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:

        The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed
        in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use
        the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.

        *A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a
        merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the
        associated payment.

        When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is
        reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of
        `SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the
        associated payment.
