type InvoicePaymentRequest struct {
	// The Square-generated ID of the payment request in an `invoice`.
	Uid string `json:"uid,omitempty"`
	// Indicates how Square processes the payment request. DEPRECATED at version 2021-01-21. Replaced by the `Invoice.delivery_method` and `InvoicePaymentRequest.automatic_payment_source` fields.  One of the following is required when creating an invoice: - (Recommended) The `delivery_method` field of the invoice. To configure an automatic payment, the `automatic_payment_source` field of the payment request is also required. - This `request_method` field. Note that `invoice` objects returned in responses do not include `request_method`. See [InvoiceRequestMethod](#type-invoicerequestmethod) for possible values
	RequestMethod string `json:"request_method,omitempty"`
	// Identifies the payment request type. This type defines how the payment request amount is determined. This field is required to create a payment request. See [InvoiceRequestType](#type-invoicerequesttype) for possible values
	RequestType string `json:"request_type,omitempty"`
	// The due date (in the invoice location's time zone) for the payment request, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.  After this date, the invoice becomes overdue. This field is required to create a payment request.
	DueDate string `json:"due_date,omitempty"`
	FixedAmountRequestedMoney *Money `json:"fixed_amount_requested_money,omitempty"`

The sum of the `percentage_requested` in all installment  payment requests must be equal to 100.  You cannot specify this when the payment `request_type` is `BALANCE` or when the  payment request specifies the `fixed_amount_requested_money` field.
	PercentageRequested string `json:"percentage_requested,omitempty"`
	// If set to true, the Square-hosted invoice page (the `public_url` field of the invoice)  provides a place for the customer to pay a tip.   This field is allowed only on the final payment request   and the payment `request_type` must be `BALANCE` or `INSTALLMENT`.
	TippingEnabled bool `json:"tipping_enabled,omitempty"`
	// The payment method for an automatic payment.  The default value is `NONE`. See [InvoiceAutomaticPaymentSource](#type-invoiceautomaticpaymentsource) for possible values
	AutomaticPaymentSource string `json:"automatic_payment_source,omitempty"`
